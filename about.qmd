# **The Art of Brainwaves: A Survey on Event-Related Potential Visualization Practices**

Hello! We conducted a survey to find out how researchers use EEG plotting tools in their daily work. Here you can find the analysis of this survey.

Check out these sections on the left panel:

1.  **Sample information** - information about our respondents (country, position, etc.) and their experience;

2.  **Visualization customs** - information about familiarity with ERP plots, attitudes towards features of analytic tools, opinions on controversial issues in ERP visualization, awareness about perceptual issues related with ERP plots;

3.  **Proficiency** - how proficiency affects researchers attitudes and visualization customs;

4.  **Naming and feedback** - how would researchers name ERP plots in a free manner, what kind of struggles they have during visualization, what kind of features they would like to have in analytic tools concerning each plot type, general feedback;

5. **Software** - on popularity of analytical tools.

*Study was conducted by Vladimir Mikheev, Ren√© Skukies and Benedikt Ehinger and supported by the Transregional Collaborative Research Center 161 (Sonderforschungsbereiche/Transregio 161, SFB-TRR 161) and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).*
