"","Tools","Plot type","Struggles","Proposed features"
"1","brain vision analyser","ERP plot","-","more user-friendly option to adapt the plot details and better export of plots"
"2","brain vision analyser","ERP plot","plot the intersecting axes at 0,0","-"
"3","brain vision analyser","ERP plot","scaling","-"
"4","brain vision analyser","ERP plot","figuring the appropriate pipeline","-"
"5","brain vision analyser","Butterfly plot","pipeline","color coding flexibility else it can be difficult to read"
"6","brain vision analyser","Topoplot","highlighting the electrodes (and large enough)","-"
"7","brain vision analyser","Topoplot","set color range","-"
"8","brain vision analyser","Topoplot","pipeline to reach here","time evolving gif type plot"
"9","brain vision analyser","Topoplot series","any specifications or tweaks (i.e., labelling)","more flexibility to plot editing and exporting"
"10","brain vision analyser","Topoplot series","set color ranges","-"
"11","brain vision analyser","Topoplot series","to select the time interval and scale of the plots","comparing different time intervals and scales might be great"
"12","brain vision analyser","Topoplot series","reaching here","-"
"13","brain vision analyser","ERP grid","combining the plots into one image with decent quality - i had to do this on my own and it took too long","flexibility in image display and exporting"
"14","brain vision analyser","ERP grid","customize position of each channel","various templates"
"15","brain vision analyser","ERP grid","scaling","changing background"
"16","brain vision analyser","ERP grid","reaching here..lol","probably a 3d version of this"
